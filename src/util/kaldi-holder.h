// The Table class uses a Holder class to wrap objects, and make them behave
// in a "normalized" way w.r.t. reading and writing, so the Table class can
// be template-ized without too much trouble. Look below this
// comment (search for GenericHolder) to see what it looks like.
//
//  Requirements of the holder class:
//
// They can only contain objects that can be read/written without external
// information; other objects cannot be stored in this type of archive.
//
// In terms of what functions it should have, see GenericHolder below.
// It is just for documentation.
//
// (1) Requirements of the Read and Write functions
//
// The Read and Write functions should have the property that in a longer
// file, if the Read function is started from where the Write function started
// writing, it should go to where the Write function stopped writing, in either
// text or binary mode (but it's OK if it doesn't eat up trailing space).
//
//     [Desirable property: when writing in text mode the output should contain
//      exactly one newline, at the end of the output; this makes it easier to manipulate]
//
//     [Desirable property for classes: the output should just be a binary-mode
//      header (if in binary mode and it's a Kaldi object, or no header
//      othewise), and then the output of Object.Write().  This means that when
//      written to individual files with the scp: type of wspecifier, we can read
//      the individual files in the "normal" Kaldi way by reading the binary
//      header and then the object.]
//
//
// The Write function takes a 'binary' argument.  In general, each object will
// have two formats: text and binary.  However, it's permitted to throw() if
// asked to read in the text format if there is none.  The file will be open, if
// the file system has binary/text modes, in the corresponding mode.  However,
// the object should have a file-mode in which it can read either text or binary
// output.  It announces this via the static IsReadInBinary() function.  This
// will generally be the binary mode and it means that where necessary, in text
// formats, we must ignore \r characters.
//
// Memory requirements: if it allocates memory, the destructor should
// free that memory.  Copying and assignment of Holder objects may be
// disallowed as the Table code never does this.
